Getting Started

Here are 2 question of python.

Prerequisites

You need to have installed the 3rd vesrion of Python.

Files Structure:

**birthdayCakeCandles.py :**
Created a function birthdayCakeCandles which takes a parameter candels, candels contain a list of ** N ** number,  In function have iterated all over the list and compared the value with max which have the first index value of list and in last return the count of max value.

**nonDivisibleSubset :**
Created a function nonDivisibleSubset which takes two parameters s and k.
The sum of 2 numbers is not evenly divisible by k if and only if the sum of their remainders is not evenly divisible by k. So I just  paired these 2 remainders, then pick one that occurs more. For the special cases, 0 or k/2 (if k is even), we count 1 for them because double of them is evenly divisible by k, and have used count() and max() functions to get the max value and count.
